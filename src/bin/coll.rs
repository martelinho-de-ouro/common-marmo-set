// Vectors
// Strings
// HashMaps

// * Strings are implemented as collection of bytes with methods to provide 
//   useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.
// * Rust has only 1 string type in the core --> `str` usually `&str`.
// * The `String` type provided by stdlib is a growable, mutable owned and UTF-8
//   encoded string type.
// * "Many of the same operations available with Vec<T> are available with 
//    String as well because String is actually implemented as a wrapper around 
//    a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, 
//    and capabilities."
// * String::from and to_string do the same thing
// * We can use the `+` operator or the `format!` macro to concatenate 
//   String values.
